    "# Bulk Upload Product Images from Google Drive to Shopify\n",

    "![picture](drive-to-shopify.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### OBJECTIVE:\n",
    "\n",
    "The following code allows Shopify store owners to bulk upload product images from a Google Drive folder to a Shopify store, via Shopify's \"import products by CSV\" feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### STEPS:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * [1. Preparation](#1)\n",
    "   * [2. Get Data from Google Drive](#2)\n",
    "   * [3. Add Google Drive Image Data to Shopify Product CSV](#3)\n",
    "   * [4. Export New Shopify Product CSV](#4)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "There are several steps that must be completed before running the code in this .ipynb file.\n",
    "\n",
    "*1. Create a Shopify product .csv file*  \n",
    "  \n",
    "A detailed description of how to create a properly formatted Shopify product .csv file can be found [here](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/products/import-export/using-csv). The product .csv file must be called shopify-products.csv, and must be located in the same directory as this .ipynb file. The product .csv file's \"Image Src\" column may be empty, or contain dataâ€”both options are fine. If there is existing \"Image Src\" data, it will be overwritten.\n",
    "\n",
    "*2. Upload product images to Google Drive*  \n",
    "\n",
    "Upload all product images to Google Drive folder. The folder must be a shared folder that is viewable to \"anyone with the link\". All product images must have a name that matches the Shopify handle of that product. If a certain product has multiple images, the first image should be named after the product's Shopify handle, and the other images should include the suffix \"-image[number]\". For example:  \n",
    "| Image Description | Shopify Handle | Image File Name |\n",
    "| --- | --- | --- |\n",
    "| the product's primary image | running-shoes | running-shoes.jpg |\n",
    "| another image of the same product | running-shoes | running-shoes-image2.jpg |\n",
    "| a third image of the same product | running-shoes | running-shoes-image3.jpg |\n",
    "\n",
    "Images may be of any file type supported by Shopify.\n",
    "\n",
    "*3. Connect to the Google Drive API*  \n",
    "\n",
    "A detailed description of how to connect to the Google Drive API can be found [here](https://developers.google.com/drive/api/quickstart/python). A video walkthrough of this process can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkWM7A-MxR0). Once the credentials file is downloaded, it must be named credentials.json and added to the same directory as this .ipynb file.\n",
